Hey,
Hi Visitor

I see you wanna know more about me

Fine then,here we go, brace yourself

I am Vinay. You can call me vinnu if you would like to. I enjoy reading books, watching anime, playing video games, going out on errands when it's cool outside.

I kind off hate coding, but really love problem solving, I learn a little bit about computers and coding from books and YouTube.
